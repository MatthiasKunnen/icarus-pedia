- [ ] https://icaruspedia.gametools.cloud/Items/Item/Smoked_Gamey_Meat shows not craftable anywhere
- [x] Why are the following items not in the list of items?
  - spoiled plants
  - meat
  - yeast

  Maybe because we need to show items that are used in craftable recipes. 
- [x] Either fix .avif being larger than .webp or remove it
